# API-Random-Quote-Generator
This program was originally built for freeCodeCamp’s <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine">“Build a Random Quote Machine!”</a> challenge. It makes use of the<a href=" https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios </a> API Promise based HTTP client to make API calls to<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json"> this API </a> with additional styling using <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. The images are all from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a> and hosted in the assets folder. The project also features twitter integration allowing the user to tweet the quote directly from the site.

The project can also be found on my codepen account <a href="https://codepen.io/nootuff/full/bGpzgvx">here</a>.
